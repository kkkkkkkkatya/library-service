### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kkkkkkkkatya/library-service.git
   cd library-service
   
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```
   Fill in the `.env` file with necessary configurations.

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Running the API
### Using Docker
#### To run the API using Docker, follow these steps:

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
- You can pull doker using command:
  ```bash
   docker pull kkkkkkkktya/library_service
   ```
- Build and start the containers:
  ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

  The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/ once the containers are up and running.
### Using localhost
  If you prefer to run the API locally without Docker, follow these steps:

Start the development server:
  ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
  ```
Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.


## Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To obtain a token:

1. **Register a user** (see the api/users/ endpoint in the API documentation).
2. **Login** with the registered credentials to receive a token (api/users/token/).
3. Include the token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
