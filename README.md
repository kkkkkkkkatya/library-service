## Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To obtain a token:

1. **Register a user** (see the api/users/ endpoint in the API documentation).
2. **Login** with the registered credentials to receive a token (api/users/token/).
3. Include the token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
